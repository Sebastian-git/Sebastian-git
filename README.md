# Introduction

#### Hi, my name is Sebastian Cevallos. I love Computer Science and will be posting most of the projects I enjoy on here to share.

## Currently I am...

ðŸŸ¢ Project manager for an e-commerce subscription website using Express, Node.js, MongoDB's Atlas, Stripe and Amazon Web Services (S3)

ðŸŸ¢ Snapchat Engineering Academy: Studying website development and applicable tools (MERN Stack, Firebase databases, Git Version Control) while having access to fireside chats with Snapchat employees

ðŸŸ¢ NASA JPL SIRI Internship: Assisting in the development of deep learning algorithms for improved semantic segmentation of satellite images using Python (Tensorflow & PyTorch) and Git while under direct mentor ship from JPL employees

## Check out some of my favorite projects:

ðŸ’š [Keylogger](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/KeyLogger) : This Python based keylogger uses Pynput to save keystrokes into an array, then sends the keys to a set email after a predetermined time interval. Still in progress, but I look forward to updating this project!
