# Introduction

#### Hi, my name is Sebastian Cevallos. I love Computer Science and will be posting most of the projects I enjoy on here to share.

## Currently I am...

游릭 Leader in the development of an e-commerce and subscription based website in a freelance job. Stripe's payment processing platform was used with Express.js to manage finances. Amazon Web Service's EC2 instance was run using Amazon Linux in collaboration with MongoDB to handle back end operations through PuTTY's SSH client.

游릭 Project manager and back end developer in the creation of the website "Snap Observatory", which uses NASA's Fireball API to inform users of the location and magnitude of fireballs after searching the minimum/maximum date constraints. Users can create accounts and save fireballs into their favorites page using Firebase as a database and Node.js for back end code. Project was made in collaboration with Snapchat Engineering Academy and is kept on my GitHub under ["north-star"](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/north-star).

游릭 Snapchat Engineering Academy scholar studying website development and applicable tools included but not limited to Firebase ([Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Firebase Auth API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)), Node.js (Express, Express-Session, EJS), personalized CSS classes, and consistent use of Git Version Control. Personalized fireside chats with executive Snapchat employees like [Derek Anderson](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/20/snap-names-derek-andersen-as-cfo.html#:~:text=Snap%20on%20Monday%20announced%20the,for%20less%20than%20a%20year.) (CFO), [Evan Spiegel](https://www.forbes.com/profile/evan-spiegel/#374ac06d529c) (CEO & Cofounder), and [Bobby Murphy](https://www.forbes.com/profile/bobby-murphy/#9fb00cc37ba5) (Cofounder) gave real world experience. In addition, each scholar received a personal mentor for the duration of the academy that worked at Snap.

游릭 NASA JPL SIRI Internship: Assisting in the development of deep learning algorithms for improved semantic segmentation of satellite images using Python (Tensorflow & PyTorch) and Git while under direct mentor ship from JPL employees.

## Check out some of my favorite projects:

游눜 [Keylogger](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/KeyLogger) : This Python based keylogger uses Pynput to save keystrokes into an array, then sends the keys to a set email after a predetermined time interval. Still in progress, but I look forward to updating this project!

游눜 [north-star](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/north-star) : In collaboration with the Snap Engineering Academy, I took the role of project manager and became the back-end developer in a group that created the website "Snap Observatory". This website takes fireball (meteor) data from the NASA Fireball API with Express.js and saves it to a database after you create an account using Firebase.
