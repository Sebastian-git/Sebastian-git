# Introduction

#### Hi, my name is Sebastian Cevallos. I love Computer Science and will be posting most of the projects I enjoy on here to share.

## Currently I am...

ðŸŸ¢ Project manager in the development of an e-commerce website using Node.js, Stripe and Amazon Web Services

ðŸŸ¢ Studying website development in the Snapchat Engineering Academy (MERN Stack, Firebase databases, Git Version Control)

ðŸŸ¢ Assisting in the development of deep learning algorithms for improved semantic segmentation of satellite images using Python through JPL's SIRI internship


## Check out some of my favorite projects:

ðŸ’š [Keylogger](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/KeyLogger) : This Python based keylogger uses Pynput to save keystrokes into an array, then sends the keys to a set email after a predetermined time interval. Still in progress, but I look forward to updating this project!
