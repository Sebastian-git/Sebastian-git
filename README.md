# Introduction

#### Hi, my name is Sebastian Cevallos. I love Computer Science and will be posting most of the projects I enjoy on here to share.

## Currently I am...

游릭 Leader in the development of an e-commerce and subscription based website. Stripe's payment processing platform was used with Express to manage finances. Amazon Web Service's EC2 instance was run using Amazon Linux in collaboration with MongoDB to handle back end operations through PuTTY's SSH client

游릭 Project manager in the development of the website North Star, which uses NASA's Fireball API to inform users of the location and magnitude of fireballs after searching the minimum/maximum date constraints. Project was made in collaboration with Snapchat Engineering Academy and is kept on my GitHub

游릭 Snapchat Engineering Academy: Studying website development and applicable tools (MERN Stack, Firebase databases, Git Version Control) while having access to fireside chats with Snapchat employees

游릭 NASA JPL SIRI Internship: Assisting in the development of deep learning algorithms for improved semantic segmentation of satellite images using Python (Tensorflow & PyTorch) and Git while under direct mentor ship from JPL employees


## Check out some of my favorite projects:

游눜 [Keylogger](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/KeyLogger) : This Python based keylogger uses Pynput to save keystrokes into an array, then sends the keys to a set email after a predetermined time interval. Still in progress, but I look forward to updating this project!
