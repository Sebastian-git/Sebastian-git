# Introduction

#### Hi, my name is Sebastian. My goal is to fill my Github account with high quality projects that express a deep understanding in practical data structures and algorithms while putting an emphasis in user experience and design.

## About me...

游릭 Lunar Trailblazer Internship: Work in mission operations for the Lunar Trailblazer mission, a joint effort between Caltech and JPL to learn more about water on the moon. Utilizing NASA's Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System Instrument Toolkit (AIT-core) API and Python, I have collaborated in the development of critical steps in the satellite communication process. (Fall 2021-Fall 2023)

游릭 Nuleep Internship: Collaborated in publication of a mobile responsive website under direct guidance from company executives. Designed dynamic front-end website features using React, Redux and TailwindCSS. Assisted in back-end development by creating user profiles with Express, Node and MongoDB stored on Azure. (Spring 2021-Spring 2022)

游릭 NASA JPL SIRI Research Internship: Assisted in the development and research of deep learning algorithms for improved semantic segmentation of satellite images using Python (Tensorflow & PyTorch) and Git while under direct mentor ship from JPL employees. (Fall 2020)

游릭 Snapchat Engineering Academy scholar: Studied website development and applicable tools included but not limited to Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Auth API), Node.js (Express, Express-Session, EJS), personalized CSS classes, and consistent use of Git Version Control. Attended personalized fireside chats with executive Snapchat employees like Derek Anderson (CFO), Evan Spiegel (CEO & Cofounder), and Bobby Murphy (Cofounder) gave real world experience. Received a personal mentor (Snap employee) for the duration of the academy. (Summer 2020)
