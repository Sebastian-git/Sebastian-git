## Check out some of my favorite projects:

ðŸ’š [Keylogger](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/KeyLogger) : This Python based keylogger uses Pynput to save keystrokes into an array, then sends the keys to a set email after a predetermined time interval. Still in progress, but I look forward to updating this project!
