## Check out some of my favorite projects:

游눜 [Speed Typing](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/SpeedTyping) : After reaching 130 WPM from constant speed typing training, I figured I would make my own speed typing program with custom input to maximize educational value.

游눜 [Keylogger](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/KeyLogger) : This Python based keylogger uses Pynput to save keystrokes into an array, then sends the keys to a set email after a predetermined time interval. Still in progress, but I look forward to updating this project!

游눜 [north-star](https://github.com/Sebastian-git/north-star) : In collaboration with the Snap Engineering Academy, I took the role of project manager and became the back-end developer in a group that created the website "Snap Observatory". This website takes fireball (meteor) data from the NASA Fireball API with Express.js and saves it to a database after you create an account using Firebase.
