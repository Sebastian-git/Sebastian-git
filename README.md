### Introduction

Hi, my name is Sebastian Cevallos. I love Computer Science and will be posting most of the projects I enjoy on here to share.

Most of the projects that will be posted here are what I consider professional and I aim to document them as well as possible through reliably named commits and a thorough readme with example images and an in-depth description.
